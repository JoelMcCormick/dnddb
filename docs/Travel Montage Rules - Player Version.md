# Overview
Travel Montages are intended to be a tool streamline getting from Point A to Point B when the DM wants the gameplay to be more engaging than a fast-travel loading screen but less tedious than a repetitive survival walking simulator. 

A DM might choose to use a montage for long journeys between cities, to traverse the wilderness surrounding a point of interest, or navigate a large relatively featureless section of a cave system enroute to a dungeon. 

Running a travel montage is fairly straightforward.  Once a destination is determined:
1. The DM splits the trip into Travel Stages and determines the DC of each stage.
2. The party designates their characters' roles during the journey and determines their travel pace.
3. The DM determines the party's Travel Roll modifier
4. A single dice roll is used to determine the outcome of travel between Checkpoints.
5. Travel Complications, role reassignments, pacing adjustments, and non-travel related player interactions (e.x.: stopping at a shop while passing through town) are resolved.  
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until destination is reached. 
# Travel Stages
Whether measured in feet, miles, or towns along a trade road, Travel Stages represent an interval of the journey's total distance.  

A single Travel Stage encompasses all of the routine activities necessary to complete that portion of the journey such as:
	- Movement
	- Reading maps or searching for objectives
	- Setting up camp
	- Meals and rests
	- Caring for pack animals
	- Setting and taking watches

## Checkpoints
Where Travel Stages are used to count distance, Checkpoints are used to measure time. 
These might be a single combat turn or several days or weeks depending on the type of travel montage being run.  
By default, each Travel Stage has one Checkpoint at the beginning of the stage, but modified travel speeds and certain complications can add additional Checkpoints to a Travel Stage.  
# Travel Roles
The first decision the party needs to make is what each player will be responsible for during travel.  
## Trip Captains
Each leg of the journey requires one character to be designated the "Trip Captain" this person will roll to determine the outcome of that stage of travel.  The party can designate one player to lead the entire trip, take turns as Trip Captain, or swap between characters as the situation dictates.  

## Other Roles 
The party can increase the likelihood of success by designating party member roles that make the trip smoother.  Each player describes what responsibilities they'll take at the start of the montage.  If desired, a player can modify their role but this must be stated between Travel Rolls.  I.e.: After any complications have been resolved and before resuming travel. 

Once roles are established, the DM will determine a final modifier that the Trip Captain will add to their Travel Roll.  
### Choosing Roles
Plan for the trip by making considerations for things like terrain, mode of transportation, and potential challenges then choose a role that suits your character's strengths.  
Some examples: 
- A character with survival proficiency might take on a navigation role if the route is unknown or leads through difficult terrains. 
- While exploring the catacombs leading to an underground temple, designating someone to check for traps or hidden passages would be advisable. 
- If the party is traveling with pack animals, designating someone to see to their wellbeing could be warranted. 
- Maybe you're a warlock that doesn't sleep and can keep watch all night to let your companions get rest without interruptions.

### Rewarding Creativity 
In some cases, the DM may rule that a player's preparations were sufficient to prevent or negate a travel complication.  Allocating spell slots to daily tasks or expending additional resources is a great way to ensure smooth sailing.  

# Travel Pace
The second decision the party makes at the start of their journey is how quickly they will travel. 
There are varying pros and cons to changing pace, but all of them affect the DC and frequency of Travel Rolls along the way.  

## Standard Pacing Options
- **Normal Pace** - The default travel speed  
	- 1 Checkpoint per Stage
	- Standard Travel Roll DC
- **Slow Pace** - Doubles the duration of travel, but reduces the likelihood of complications. 
	- 2 Checkpoints per Stage
	- -25% to Travel DC
		- Equivalent of +4 to Travel Roll on Average
	- May give Advantage to ability checks related to Travel Complications.
- **Fast Pace** - Maximum sustainable travel pace.  Reduced travel time at the risk of complications.
	- 2 Checkpoints per Stage
	- Travel Roll every 3rd Checkpoint
	- +25% to Travel DC
		- Equivalent of -5 to Travel Roll on Average
	- May impose Disadvantage to ability checks related to Travel Complications

## Special Pacing Options
- **Stealthy Pace** - Slow and careful travel that can be used to avoid complications at the expense of time.  
	- 3 Checkpoints per Stage
	- -50% to Travel DC
		- Equivalent of +9 to Travel Roll on Average
	- May give Advantage to ability checks related to Travel Complications.
	- Provides the possibility of avoiding/preventing certain Travel Complications.
	- Enemy combatants must succeed on a perception roll contested by the party's stealth at the start of combat encounter complications. If the party remains undetected they may choose to take a surprise round or evade combat entirely.  (Most random encounter enemies will not pursue the party)
- **Extreme Pace** - Gotta go fast! A risky pace that doubles travel speed for when time is critical. 
	- 1 Checkpoint per Stage
	- Travel Roll every other Checkpoint
	- +50% to Travel DC
		- Equivalent of -9 to Travel Roll on Average
	- May impose Disadvantage to ability checks related to Travel Complications
	- Each member of the party must succeed on a CON Save or suffer 1 point of Exhaustion.  
		- The baseline DC is determined by the DM based on Checkpoint length, situation, and preparation. 
		- Subsequent checks cumulatively add +2 to the baseline.  
		- Points of Exhaustion can only be removed in one of two ways during a Travel Montage:
			- Through use of magic such as Greater Restoration or Potion of Vitality.
			- Stopping to rest.  Progress along the route is halted until the group recovers, potentially resulting in additional complications.      
# Travel Rolls
The Travel Roll represents the overall success of the various routine tasks and challenges the party faced throughout the day.  When the party crosses a Checkpoint along the route, the Trip Captain rolls a d20 to determine the outcome of the *next* stage of the journey.  

On a success, the party travels without issue and proceeds to the next Checkpoint as planned.  
On a failure, the DM rolls on the relevant Travel Complications table to determine the outcome. 

## Modifiers
At the start of the Travel Montage the DM will determine the groups Travel Modifier based on the player's stated preparations.   The Travel Modifier can be adjusted between Checkpoints due to Travel Complications or if players change their strategy.  

In general, this will be the only modifier applied to the Travel Roll and the only guaranteed means of gaining Advantage on the roll is for a player to use Inspiration.  
### Buff Effects
Temporary effects that grant bonuses to dice rolls or give Advantage do not affect the Travel Roll unless the effect lasts the entire duration of a Checkpoint *and* provides a bonus to at least half of the party with designated Travel Roles.  

However, the DM can account for these effects while setting the party's Travel Modifier if a player states their intent to incorporate a spell, potion, or item into their travel routine.  
## Travel Complications
A Travel Complication is an unexpected event that requires players to make decisions.  They will likely vary significantly from montage to montage depending on the scenario and setting, but should never be exclusively random combat encounters. 
Example non-combat complications:
- A player twists their ankle, forcing the party to slow their pace for a time. 
- One of the horses gets loose and bolts, time is lost rounding it back up which adds a checkpoint to the journey.
- Someone spots a secret passageway in a dungeon.  Maybe it leads to a treasure room or maybe it's a shortcut.  Players must decide whether to press on or investigate further.  
- The party encounters a wandering merchant selling rare goods.  They stop for an impromptu shopping spree, but make up the lost time and arrive to the next Checkpoint on schedule.
- The scout spots a roadside sign advertising the teleportation services offered by a wizard in a nearby town.  The party must decide whether to gamble on taking a significant detour in hopes of reaching their destination sooner.
