# Game Information
## Schedule 
Weekly sessions are held on Wednesdays from 8PM to 11PM Central.    
I will occasionally ask the group for a 7:30 start if I have a lot planned for the session, but end times are normally a hard stop. (Give or take a few minutes to reach a smooth ending point)

In the event of a canceled session, I'll reach out to players to see if an alternate day/time can be found.  There is no obligation or expectation to be available outside of normal session times.  

## Breaks
I usually try to plan for a 10 minute break around the halfway point of the session, but there won't always be one.  
If you need to step away for a moment, do so as unobtrusively as possible.  Hand off your character or send your intended action in chat if you're likely to miss a combat turn.  
## Absences
We're all adults and understand that life sometimes requires reprioritizing your time.  

Please provide as much advanced notice as you can when scheduling conflicts come up.   

We will plan to play around player absences unless a majority of the group votes to reschedule or an absent character is central to the current mission/story.   
### Uncontrolled Player Characters 
- **Downtime** - If the party is between missions and it makes narrative sense to do so, absent players' characters will make an excuse to separate from the party for the session.  
- **On Mission** - If there's no narrative excuse for a character to separate from the party, the DM will designate a player to control them in combat.  Alternatively, you can give control of your character to a specific player.  
- **Extended Absences** - If you need to step away from the game for a while, I'll work with you to plan what your character does in the interim.  

## Individual and Makeup Sessions
Occasionally there may be in-game scenarios that would exclude all or a significant number of players for an extended time.  Rather than tie up the entire table, I may ask the relevant players to schedule a short "bonus" session.  
Being excluded from an extracurricular session isn't personal, it simply means your character wasn't involved in that part of the narrative and the player would have nothing to do.  Other players are usually welcome to spectate these sessions, but non-participants will be muted.   

If a player misses a critical campaign moment, I'll try to find a time to give the character an opportunity to participate.

Unless the content of a breakout session is critical to the mission/narrative, players will be responsible for deciding what and how much they share with the party.  (I prefer that this happens in-character, but it's ok if you'd rather just share notes )

# Table Rules
## Player Conduct
### Rule 0: Don't be _that_ guy. 
Be respectful of the other people at the table.
This should be mostly self-explanatory, but for clarity, this at a minimum means:
- Don't push players into scenarios they're uncomfortable with
- Let others contribute to the conversation in-game and above table
- Recognize when your character isn't in the spotlight.  
- Don't intentionally sabotage the mission/story.  (Unless you've talked with me about it at length and in advance.)
- Be open to other ideas and constructive criticism of your own.

### Game Flow
3 hours isn't a lot of time for a DND session, especially with a party of this size.  To make sure the story moves forward as efficiently as possible I ask that players:
- Be ready to play when the session starts.  
- Keep cross-talk to a minimum.  
	- This isn't me saying "NO CHATTER."  It's a social game, be social.  Just don't let tangential conversation prevent the game from moving forward.  
- Stay engaged with the RP
	- Unless there's a technical issue, your camera should be on the majority of the time your character is involved in an RP encounter.  It provides the visual cues players need to know you're participating in the conversation. 
	- Distractions happen, but nothing derails a story moment more reliably than "Huh, were you talking to me? What are we talking about?"  
- Be ready to take your turn in combat.  Plan ahead, have a backup plan if the scenario evolves and know what dice you'll need to roll.  (Obviously, nobody expects you to master a character sheet immediately.  There's plenty of leeway during the learning curve.) 
- Don't argue DM judgement calls
	- You can absolutely ask for advantage, make a case for a lower DC on a check, or seek a rule clarification, but if the DM decides against it don't argue the point.  
	- If you aren't happy with how something is ruled, send me a private message and we'll work it out.  If I made a bad call that can be retconned, we'll do so, otherwise I'll find another way to make it up to the affected characters.  (Inspiration, finding a random healing potion, refund a spell slot, or whatever makes the most sense.)

### Non-participating guests
If you want to have a guest present to observe the game, I ask that you clear it with the entire group in advance and make their presence as unobtrusive as possible.   Please avoid having your guest in frame on your camera and mute your microphone if you need to explain something or have a side conversation.  

Keep in mind, any random session probably won't be a good introduction to the game simply because there's a high potential for the it to be boring.   

```
Note: I'd much rather introduce someone to the game as a player.  We can roll up basic starter character in a few minutes, and have them come along for the ride as a temporary guest.  It'll be more fun for everyone involved.
```


### Conflict Resolution
The only drama at this table should be from the narrative.  
Should they arise, interpersonal conflicts between players should take every reasonable step to avoid interfering with others' ability to enjoy the game.  Try to resolve the issue privately outside of game time or bring your concerns to me directly so I can attempt to mediate.  
### Retiring / Reconfiguring a Character
Sometimes a character doesn't pan out the way you imagined.  If you're not happy with your build or the character, don't just throw yourself off a cliff.  Please come to me and we'll find a way to smoothly transition you to another character without throwing away the work we've done on writing your story.

## Gameplay

### House Rules
I run the game with a few modifications and additions to the core rules.  
New or modified rules will sometimes get implemented if I think it will add to the game, but never without discussing it with the table first.  
#### The Rule to Rule them All: Rule of Cool
I reserve the right to change, modify, or blatantly ignore any and all game mechanics and rules if doing so will result in a better story.  
The primary effect of this is that **creature stat blocks will almost always be modified** to give them non-standard hit point maximums, armor classes, abilities, etc.  

It also means that NPCs will sometimes be able to do dope shit that player characters can't.

But the rule of cool benefits you too.  Sometimes a player will ask to try something that isn't technically within the rules, but drives the story in a fun or interesting way.  
	- If it's a small concession to the rules or a narrative flavoring of one of their abilities, the DM will usually just let it happen.  
	- Using a spell/ability to achieve something that it shouldn't be able to will (rarely) result in a "Rule of Cool" check.  Usually this is a d100 with a target roll set by the DM such as "Roll under a 7" or "Roll exactly 42"

#### Consumables
**Potions** - Taking a potion is considered a Bonus Action.  Administering a potion to another creature is still considered an Action.  

**Ammo** - Managing ammunition, if necessary, is the player's responsibility.  When combat ends, 50% of mundane ammunition can be recovered without a check unless the situation dictates more/less could be recovered.  

**Spell Effect Items** - If a magic item is used to cast a spell, unless otherwise stated in the item's description, you do not need to maintain concentration on the spell.  **However**: If the player who cast the spell falls unconscious, the effect ends.  
#### Narrative Critical Failures
When a 1 is rolled on a d20 check:
- Natural 1's on ability checks are not automatic failures.  Ability modifiers are always used to calculate the result.  If the result still doesn't meet the DC of the check, it is considered a crit fail. 
- In combat, rolling a 1 is an automatic miss.  

Nat ones are part of the game.  Sometimes they drive the story in fun ways, but usually they just suck.  To make them more likely to fall into the former category, I prompt players to narratively describe how they blundered their attempt.  

This is always for flavor and never affects subsequent rolls or applies an undesired status condition.  (i.e. If you describe yourself tripping, you aren't considered prone unless you want to be)

#### Crunchy Crits
When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, instead of doubling the number of dice rolled, the maximum dice value is added as bonus damage. 

Calculating damage:

- Roll the damage as normal
- Add the normal attack modifier
- Add the maximum potential value of the damage dice

For example an attack that normally does 1d6+3 will crit for 1d6+9 (1d6+3+6)

#### RP Initiative
RP Initiative is a tool that I use to call attention to the importance of an RP encounter and ensure that all players are afforded the opportunity to participate in the conversations. 

Similar to combat, characters are placed in initiative order to determine the 

#### Passage of Time
Unless the party is mid-dungeon or on a time-sensitive mission, in-game time passes in real time.  
This provides a mechanism for the story to progress more fluidly and provides players consistent opportunities for downtime activity.  

#### Modified Spells and Items

- Spells:
	- Modified: [Detect Thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts) - This is treated as though NPCs do not have surface level inner monologues.  On cast you learn the target's emotional state and what they're paying attention to.  The caster does not receive verbal information until the target has an opportunity to save from the effect.  
		- This campaign prominently features powerful psionic characters.  Some of them may be able to notice, block, or counter this spell.  An insight check can be used to determine if a character noticed you snooping around.  
- Items:
	- Modified: [Ring of Mind Shielding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4725-ring-of-mind-shielding)- Can not be chosen as starting equipment.  Exists within the game but Is considered a Very Rare item

# Character Creation
We use DnD Beyond to create and track character sheets. 

## First a word about customization
So far, to name a few, we've reskinned a wolf into a flying platypus, given a warlock psionic powers, turned a barbarian into a golden retriever, and put a monk in plate armor that redefines his subclass.  

I'm almost unreasonably flexible about letting players build the characters they want to play, but I do have to maintain the ability to create interesting combat encounters for the entire party, so I have to enforce some limitations.  

Min-Max'ing/Optimizing your build is perfectly fine and encouraged to an extent, but I reserve the right to veto builds that exploit loopholes in the game's mechanics.  If you found it on TikTok, it's probably not allowed. 

If there's a story you want to tell, we'll find a way to make it work.  Just be willing to compromise and be patient if I decide to make it part of your character arc.  

## Creating a backstory
You can be as thorough in your character's backstory as you want.
Whether you want to flesh out an entire plotline or simply pick a hometown, I'll work with you to tie your story into the campaign as we go.  

There's really only one consideration you need to make when coming up with your character's story:

```
Your character is the hero of their story, but they are *not* the main character of the campaign 
```


Your character and their prior exploits are largely unknown to the world at large when they enter the story.  

Any ties to NPCs or factions won't provide the ability to call in a favor for anything more than a meeting with an important person or a safe place to stay.  (Unless you roll well on the persuasion check)
## Sources
Mostly anything goes as far as officially published content, but a lot things that come out of the campaign settings and adventures can cause balance issues and therefore anything found in them will require some consideration before being approved.  

The by-approval supplemental books are either too new, not out yet, and/or there because of their relevance to this campaign's story and I want to ensure character concepts using those sources don't conflict with the narrative.

	- Core Rulebooks 
		- Player's Handbook

		- Volo's Guide to Monsters

		- Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse
	- All Published Campaign Settings 
	- All Published Adventures
- Not allowed: 
	- Homebrew
	- Classes/subclasses updated from previous editions

## Ability Scores and HP
Use the Point Buy method to determine initial ability scores. 

Remember that your stats, not your backstory, determine the character's ability to pass skill checks.  

Hit points will be rolled the first session you play.  The minimum roll on hit dice is 2.   

## Starting Equipment 
(Last updated for late tier 2)
We’ll work together to determine a fair magic item build in a few stages. 

### Step 1: Standard Load-out
Add the following to your inventory during character creation:
- The default allotment of Adventuring Gear in DnD Beyond
- 3500 Gold
- 
- Mundane weapons and armor for your intended play style. 
- Any items necessary to use your class and subclass features
- For casters - Spell Material Components:
	- Any non-consumed items worth 100g or less
	- One non-consumed item worth up to 1000g
	- Up to 500g of consumable spell components, including materials for learning spells.
		- Additional consumables can be “purchased” using your starting funds. 
- Tools, kits, or instruments you are proficient with. 
- Mundane Items related to your character’s background / personality.

### Step 2: Starting Magic Items
Magic items that affect combat effectiveness will be chosen by me. (Weapons, Armor, Shields, Spell Focuses, Etc.)
You can add magic items of your choice that provide utility, situational benefits, or quality of life in one of the following ways:
- Option 1:
	- 1 Rare (Blue) magic item 
	- 2 Uncommon (Green) magic items
- Option 2:
	- 2 Rares (Blue)
- Option 3:
	- 3 Uncommon (Green)
	- 2 Consumables (Spell scrolls, potions, etc)

In addition, add the following:
- 3 Common (white) quality magic items
- 1 Handy Haversack
- 3 potions of healing
- 1 potion of greater healing

You can “purchase” additional healing potions from your starting gold fund at the following pricing:
- Potion of Healing - 50g each
- Potion of Greater Healing - 300g each
- Potion of Superior Healing - 750g each

### Step 3: Creating a Loot Wishlist
Put together the list of gear you’d want for the character if you could build it without limitations.  
This list can be as short or long as you’d like.  You can include consumables, ammunition, spells, equipment, horses, the kitchen sink.  Whatever you think you might want now, and/or in the near future to get your preferred build accomplished.  

### Step 4: Finalization
I’ll use this list to determine what additional gear you get assigned the first session and add the rest to the pool of potential future loot drops.  

We'll discuss the playstyle you're hoping to achieve and find or invent ways to help you eventually get there.
